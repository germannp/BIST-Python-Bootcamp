    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Making nice plots is an involved and painful task. A few paradigms emerged over the decades, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. Restricting to plotting functions and statistical data, R as a language for statistical processing is popular in no small part due to its plotting module, [ggplot2](http://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/), which implements a school of plotting called *grammar of graphics*. This is a *declarative* approach, subsequent statements added to the plot define the final looks. On the other hand, Python's main plotting module, a behemoth called [Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/), is *object-oriented*: the figure is made up of a hierarchy of classes, and the properties of these will decide the look of the final image. Matplotlib is complex and you will often get the impression that it was designed to make plotting simple things difficult, and its default settings do not produce the most beautiful plots on the planet. The module [Seaborn](http://seaborn.pydata.org/) wraps around Matplotlib, and for a restricted set of plot types, it makes your task very easy. It also changes the horrific defaults of Matplotlib, so importing will change the look of all of your plots, whether they were done with Matplotlib calls or with Seaborn. This is why we do not import it in the first cell of this notebook. Seaborn also makes plotting statistical data easy and it interoperates marvellously with the statistical package [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/). Python also has modules for *declarative plotting*; try [Altair](https://altair-viz.github.io/), and see [this write-up](https://dansaber.wordpress.com/2016/10/02/a-dramatic-tour-through-pythons-data-visualization-landscape-including-ggplot-and-altair/) why it is interesting in the first place. Here we will discuss only the object-oriented approach of Matplotlib and Seaborn. Finally, we will discuss [Bokeh](http://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/), a tool for making interactive plots.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, as usual, we load the corresponding libraries. For this part we will use, apart from Matplotlib and Seaborn, Numpy for handling arrays and operations, and Pandas for dataset manipulations."

    "The image that you see displayed is composed of a hierarchical structure of components. On the top level, it is an instance of the `Figure` class. This is what `plt.plot()` creates for you, with all the other underlying structures within; this function is for your convenience to avoid dealing with classes if you want a simple plot. The structures in the hierarchy include the area where you draw, which is technically called the `Axes` class. You may have more than one `Axes` if you have subplots or embedded plots. `Axes` than have x and y axes, which in turn have a scale, ticks, labels, and so on. If you have a single `Axes` class instantiated, like in the examples below, you can access and change most parts of the hierarchy like you did above with the x and y labels and the figure title. If you want to do anything non-trivial, you have to compose the figure and its components yourself. The examples in this section are mainly from [this tutorial](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jrjohansson/scientific-python-lectures/blob/master/Lecture-4-Matplotlib.ipynb).
